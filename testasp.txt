[+] [1] Cross-Site Request Forgery
[~] ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[~] Digest:     2143113859
[~] Severity:   High

[~] URL:        http://testasp.vulnweb.com/showforum.asp?id=1
[~] Element:    form
[~] All inputs: tfText, tfSubject

[~] Tags: csrf, rdiff, form, token

[~] Description: 
[~] 
In the majority of today's web applications, clients are required to submit forms
which can perform sensitive operations.

An example of such a form being used would be when an administrator wishes to
create a new user for the application.

In the simplest version of the form, the administrator would fill-in:

* Name
* Password
* Role (level of access)

Continuing with this example, Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) would occur when
the administrator is tricked into clicking on a link, which if logged into the
application, would automatically submit the form without any further interaction.

Cyber-criminals will look for sites where sensitive functions are performed in
this manner and then craft malicious requests that will be used against clients
via a social engineering attack.

There are 3 things that are required for a CSRF attack to occur:

1. The form must perform some sort of sensitive action.
2. The victim (the administrator the example above) must have an active session.
3. Most importantly, all parameter values must be **known** or **guessable**.

Arachni discovered that all parameters within the form were known or predictable
and therefore the form could be vulnerable to CSRF.

_Manual verification may be required to check whether the submission will then
perform a sensitive action, such as reset a password, modify user profiles, post
content on a forum, etc._

[+] [4] SQL Injection
[~] ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[~] URL:        http://testasp.vulnweb.com/Search.asp
[~] Element:    form
[~] Method:     GET
[~] Input name: tfSearch
[~] All inputs: tfSearch

[~] Tags: sql, injection, regexp, database, error

[~] Description: 
[~] 
Due to the requirement for dynamic content of today's web applications, many
rely on a database backend to store data that will be called upon and processed
by the web application (or other programs).
Web applications retrieve data from the database by using Structured Query Language
(SQL) queries.

To meet demands of many developers, database servers (such as MSSQL, MySQL,
Oracle etc.) have additional built-in functionality that can allow extensive
control of the database and interaction with the host operating system itself.

An SQL injection occurs when a value originating from the client's request is used
within a SQL query without prior sanitisation. This could allow cyber-criminals
to execute arbitrary SQL code and steal data or use the additional functionality
of the database server to take control of more server components.

The successful exploitation of a SQL injection can be devastating to an
organisation and is one of the most commonly exploited web application vulnerabilities.

This injection was detected as Arachni was able to cause the server to respond to
the request with a database related error.

[+] [5] Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
[~] ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[~] Input name: tfSearch
[~] All inputs: tfSearch

[~] Tags: xss, regexp, injection, script

[~] Description: 
[~] 
Client-side scripts are used extensively by modern web applications.
They perform from simple functions (such as the formatting of text) up to full
manipulation of client-side data and Operating System interaction.

Cross Site Scripting (XSS) allows clients to inject scripts into a request and
have the server return the script to the client in the response. This occurs
because the application is taking untrusted data (in this example, from the client)
and reusing it without performing any validation or sanitisation.

If the injected script is returned immediately this is known as reflected XSS.
If the injected script is stored by the server and returned to any client visiting
the affected page, then this is known as persistent XSS (also stored XSS).

Arachni has discovered that it is possible to insert script content directly into
HTML element content.

[~] Description: 
[~] 
Due to the requirement for dynamic content of today's web applications, many
rely on a database backend to store data that will be called upon and processed
by the web application (or other programs).
Web applications retrieve data from the database by using Structured Query Language
(SQL) queries.

To meet demands of many developers, database servers (such as MSSQL, MySQL,
Oracle etc.) have additional built-in functionality that can allow extensive
control of the database and interaction with the host operating system itself.

An SQL injection occurs when a value originating from the client's request is used
within a SQL query without prior sanitisation. This could allow cyber-criminals
to execute arbitrary SQL code and steal data or use the additional functionality
of the database server to take control of more server components.

The successful exploitation of a SQL injection can be devastating to an
organisation and is one of the most commonly exploited web application vulnerabilities.

This injection was detected as Arachni was able to cause the server to respond to
the request with a database related error.

[~] Description: 
[~] 
A modern web application will be reliant on several different programming languages.

These languages can be broken up in two flavours. These are client-side languages
(such as those that run in the browser -- like JavaScript) and server-side
languages (which are executed by the server -- like ASP, PHP, JSP, etc.) to form
the dynamic pages (client-side code) that are then sent to the client.

Because all server side code should be executed by the server, it should never be
seen by the client. However in some scenarios, it is possible that:

1. The server side code has syntax errors and therefore is not executed by the
    server but is instead sent to the client.
2. Using crafted requests it is possible to force the server into displaying the
    source code of the application without executing it.

As the server-side source code often contains sensitive information, such as
database connection strings or details into the application workflow, this can be
extremely risky.

Cyber-criminals will attempt to discover pages that either accidentally or
forcefully allow the server-side source code to be disclosed, to assist in
discovering further vulnerabilities or sensitive information.

Arachni has detected server-side source code within the server's response.

_(False positives may occur when requesting binary files such as images
(.JPG or .PNG) and may require manual verification.)_

control of the database and interaction with the host operating system itself.

An SQL injection occurs when a value originating from the client's request is used
within a SQL query without prior sanitisation. This could allow cyber-criminals
to execute arbitrary SQL code and steal data or use the additional functionality
of the database server to take control of more server components.

The successful exploitation of a SQL injection can be devastating to an
organisation and is one of the most commonly exploited web application vulnerabilities.

This injection was detected as Arachni was able to cause the server to respond to
the request with a database related error.

[~] Description: 
[~] 
Web applications occasionally use parameter values to store the address of the
page to which the client will be redirected -- for example:
`yoursite.com/page.asp?redirect=www.yoursite.com/404.asp`

An unvalidated redirect occurs when the client is able to modify the affected
parameter value in the request and thus control the location of the redirection.
For example, the following URL `yoursite.com/page.asp?redirect=www.anothersite.com`
will redirect to `www.anothersite.com`.

Cyber-criminals will abuse these vulnerabilities in social engineering attacks
to get users to unknowingly visit malicious web sites.

Arachni has discovered that the server does not validate the parameter value prior
to redirecting the client to the injected value.

[~] Description: 
[~] 
The HTTP protocol by itself is clear text, meaning that any data that is
transmitted via HTTP can be captured and the contents viewed.

To keep data private, and prevent it from being intercepted, HTTP is often
tunnelled through either Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), or Transport Layer Security
(TLS).
When either of these encryption standards are used it is referred to as HTTPS.

Cyber-criminals will often attempt to compromise credentials passed from the
client to the server using HTTP.
This can be conducted via various different Man-in-The-Middle (MiTM) attacks or
through network packet captures.

Arachni discovered that the affected page contains a `password` input, however,
the value of the field is not sent to the server utilising HTTPS. Therefore it
is possible that any submitted credential may become compromised.

In typical form-based web applications, it is common practice for developers to
allow `autocomplete` within the HTML form to improve the usability of the page.
With `autocomplete` enabled (default), the browser is allowed to cache previously
entered form values.

For legitimate purposes, this allows the user to quickly re-enter the same data
when completing the form multiple times.

When `autocomplete` is enabled on either/both the username and password fields,
this could allow a cyber-criminal with access to the victim's computer the ability
to have the victim's credentials automatically entered as the cyber-criminal
visits the affected page.

Arachni has discovered that the affected page contains a form containing a
password field that has not disabled `autocomplete`.

[~] Description: 
[~] 
Web applications are often made up of multiple files and directories.

It is possible that over time some files may become unreferenced (unused)
by the web application and forgotten about by the administrator/developer.
Because web applications are built using common frameworks, they contain common
files that can be discovered (independent of server).

During the initial recon stages of an attack, cyber-criminals will attempt to
locate unreferenced files in the hope that the file will assist in further
compromise of the web application.
To achieve this they will make thousands of requests using word lists containing
common filenames.
The response headers from the server will then indicate if the file exists.

Arachni also contains a list of common file names which it will attempt to access.

[~] Description: 
[~] 
Clickjacking (User Interface redress attack, UI redress attack, UI redressing)
is a malicious technique of tricking a Web user into clicking on something different
from what the user perceives they are clicking on, thus potentially revealing
confidential information or taking control of their computer while clicking on
seemingly innocuous web pages.

The server didn't return an `X-Frame-Options` header which means that this website
could be at risk of a clickjacking attack.

The `X-Frame-Options` HTTP response header can be used to indicate whether or not
a browser should be allowed to render a page inside a frame or iframe. Sites can
use this to avoid clickjacking attacks, by ensuring that their content is not
embedded into other sites.

[~] Description: 
[~] 
There are a number of HTTP methods that can be used on a webserver (`OPTIONS`,
`HEAD`, `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` etc.).  Each of these methods perform a
different function and each have an associated level of risk when their use is
permitted on the webserver.

A client can use the `OPTIONS` method within a request to query a server to
determine which methods are allowed.

Cyber-criminals will almost always perform this simple test as it will give a
very quick indication of any high-risk methods being permitted by the server.

Arachni discovered that several methods are supported by the server.

[~] Description: 
[~] 
HTTP by itself is a stateless protocol. Therefore the server is unable to determine
which requests are performed by which client, and which clients are authenticated
or unauthenticated.

The use of HTTP cookies within the headers, allows a web server to identify each
individual client and can therefore determine which clients hold valid
authentication, from those that do not. These are known as session cookies.

When a cookie is set by the server (sent the header of an HTTP response) there
are several flags that can be set to configure the properties of the cookie and
how it is to be handled by the browser.

The `HttpOnly` flag assists in the prevention of client side-scripts (such as
JavaScript) accessing and using the cookie.

This can help prevent XSS attacks targeting the cookies holding the client's
session token (setting the `HttpOnly` flag does not prevent, nor safeguard against
XSS vulnerabilities themselves).

Analyzes the scan results and logs issues which persist across different pages.

This is usually a sign for a lack of a central/single point of input sanitization,
a bad coding practise.
